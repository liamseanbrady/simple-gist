# Simple Gist

This is a second try at building a client for dealing with Github gists via the command line.

During the first try ([gistdoit](https://github.com/liamseanbrady/gistdoit))I prematurely created abstractions and made design decsions without justifying why they needed to be made. This resulted in an architecture that was inflexiable and unnecessarily complex.
